# CPS_Tester
A website made in React, that allows you to test your CPS (click per seconds).

There's 2 issues: first the score front that i'll upgrade soon, and the register that allows 2 users with the same mails and same username, and i will try to add a mail verification to verify the accounts.

## How to setup?

`cd CPS_Server`
`npm start`

to run the backend
and 
`cd CPS_Tester`
`npm run build`
`npm start`
to build and run the frontend
